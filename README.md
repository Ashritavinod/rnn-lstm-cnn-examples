# Sequential and Convolutional Models in PyTorch

This notebook demonstrates the implementation and training of fundamental neural network architectures using PyTorch, focusing on sequential and image-based tasks.

## 📘 Included Models

### 🔁 LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- Designed for sequential data and time series
- Predicts sine wave values
- Evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### 🔁 RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
- Basic RNN trained on a sine wave sequence
- Compares with LSTM performance

### 🔁 BI-RNN (Bidirectional RNN)
- Processes data in both forward and backward directions
- Enhances sequential context understanding

### 🧠 BPTT (Backpropagation Through Time)
- Manual implementation of a basic RNN cell
- Demonstrates gradient updates through time steps

### 🖼️ CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- Trained on the MNIST dataset
- Classic architecture for image classification

## 🚀 Getting Started
